{"name":"PGP Keys","tagline":"","body":"Antony Bailey Public PGP Keys\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nWhat is PGP?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n>\"Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a data encryption and decryption computer program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication.\r\n>PGP is often used for signing, encrypting and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories and whole disk partitions to increase the \r\nsecurity of e-mail communications. \r\n>It was created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991.\r\nPGP and similar products follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880 ) for encrypting and decrypting data.\" -- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)\r\n\r\nWhy would I need them?\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contact me and encrypt the data being transmitted you can use my public key. This means that only I can read the contents of your communication.\r\n\r\nHow do I use this public key?\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nYou should download a Keyring application. Some examples of which are:\r\n\r\n* [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org)\r\n* [Gpg4win](http://www.gpg4win.org)\r\n\r\nIt is personal preference. Please ensure you are using a secure application that has been peer reviewed. I would recommend you look for a program with open source code so you can build yourself to ensure that you have a clean install.\r\n\r\nCan you gaurantee my communication is secure?\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNo. I take all precautions to ensure that my own data and devices are without fault. I cannot and **will** not be held responsible for any issues arrising from security implications. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
